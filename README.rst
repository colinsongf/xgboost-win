XGBoost Python Package
======================

This is simply a Windows (both 32 and 64 bit) compiled version of the popular
xgboost (Scalable, Portable and Distributed Gradient Boosting) package for Python 2.x,
without any modifications. The compilation for Windows OS seems a rather tedious and
complicated process, thus, this package includes everything that is needed to
run this tool. It can be installed from the GitHub simply using pip.

The original version is found in <https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost>; if you are
using *nix based version, please install from the original source or just using
`pip install xgboost`

As noted in the README of the original package, this pip installation may not
work on some windows environment, and it may cause unexpected errors. pip
installation on windows is currently disabled for further investigation, therefore,
use this package at your own risk.
